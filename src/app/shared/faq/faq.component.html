                             <p class="mb-3">The annual fees and administrative charges for all credit cards are non-refundable. Customers who wish to request a refund for their purchases must contact the merchant directly and the refund will be returned to the original payment channel. Due to international settlement procedures, the refund process may take 3-7 business days.</p>
                             <h5 class="mb-2">Why was my payment deducted successfully even though the transaction failed?</h5>
                             <p class="mb-3">This may happen when there is a communication failure between the third-party payment system and the Mastercard clearing gateway. Although the payment appears to have been deducted, it is only a pre-authorization freeze. The refund process will take 3-7 business days to be returned to the original payment channel. Please be patient during this time.</p>
